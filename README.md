ChiBench consists of a large collection of Verilog programs mined from open-source github repositories.
The goal of this benchmark suite is to test and debug high-level synthesis tools, such as the [Jasper Formal Verification Platform](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/system-design-and-verification/formal-and-static-verification.html).
